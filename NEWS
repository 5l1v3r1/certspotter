v0.4 (2017-04-03)
  * Add PuChuangSiDa 1 log
  * Remove Venafi log due to fork and disqualification from Chrome

v0.3 (2017-02-20)
  * Revise -all_time flag (behavior change):
    - If -all_time is specified, scan the entirety of all logs, even
      existing logs
    - When a new log is added, scan it in its entirety even if -all_time
      is not specified
  * Add new logs:
    - Google Icarus
    - Google Skydiver
    - StartCom
    - WoSign
  * Overhaul log processing and auditing logic:
    - STHs are never deleted unless they can be verified
    - Multiple unverified STHs can be queued per log, laying groundwork
      for STH pollination support
    - New state directory layout; current state directories will be
      migrated, but migration will be removed in a future version
    - Persist condensed Merkle Tree state between runs, instead of
      reconstructing it from consistency proof every time
  * Use a lock file to prevent multiple instances of Cert Spotter from
    running concurrently (which could clobber the state directory).
  * Minor bug fixes and improvements

v0.2 (2016-08-25)
  * Suppress duplicate identifiers in output.
  * Fix "EOF" error when running under Go 1.7.
  * Fix bug where hook script could fail silently.
  * Fix compilation under Go 1.5.

v0.1 (2016-07-27)
  * Initial release.
